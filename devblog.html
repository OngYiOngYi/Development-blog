            <h1 class="week">Week 1</h1>
            <p class="text">In week 1, i've learnt about html elements. I've tried simple importing of images into a website and change it's height and width. 
                I've also learnt on href, linking websites to a text. Background color is also something i tried, changing the color behind a text.
                For the task this week, i've created a simple website on a recipe for spaghetti, using a simple table, ordered list, as well as 
                unordered list.

        <div class="box">
            <h1 class="week">Week 2</h1>
            <p class="text">For week 2, i've learnt about CSS and Semantics, such as header, nav, etc. I also learnt about how CSS can change how a webpage looks.
                I also learnt that using inspect on google allows us to see parts of the code. Inline style allows us to easily change a style of a 
                semantic easily. Class allows us to change a few semantic into the same format by giving them the same class.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="box">
            <h1 class="week">Week 3</h1>
            <p class="text">In week 3, i've learnt about forms in html. For example, the form, input and label tags. Validations were also something that i've used
                in this week's task. (When input email, "@" is required). I've also learnt how the browsers decide on which CSS command to produce the output. For
                this, i also learnt on the "!important" function, which will force the CSS to take the command from the code that has the important label. Media query 
                were also taught this week. I've learnt how to use simple media query codes to change the background color of a page when it reaches a mimiumn width.
                Positioning also allows us to change the element according to the page. Layering were also taught, by using z-index we can place some items above each
                other. Flex box allows us to arrange different div together and appears well when in media query.
            </p>

        <div class="box">
            <h1 class="week">Week 4</h1>
            <p class="text">For this week, i've learnt on responsive images. It enables the system to auto-resize the image when the width or height of the display is changed.
                By using the flex box taught from last week, i've manged to do the task that requires 6 images to be arranged together and requires media query. I also set up my 
                Github account in preparation of Assignment 1.

            <h1 class="week">Week 5</h1>
            <p class="text">This week i learnt simple javascript from LinkedIn learning, since it was the ICT brightspace week. The LinkedIn videos were able to effectively teach 
                me as they were simple to understand and the pacing were good. The lessons are also recorded thus, enabling us togo back to a part where we didn't understand as well,
                and do the practics questions, that were simple to understand. I also continued to work on my assignment for a band.

        <div class="box">
            <h1 class="week">Week 6</h1>
            <p class="text">For this week, there were further elaboration on javascript, and I've learnt on how a function, loops and logical operators works in javascript. Moreover, i've
                learnt on how objects work in javascript. For example, creating and adding objects. Accessing elements in a DOM tree were also something i learnt, and getting element by it's
                ID.
            </p>

        <div class="box">
            <h1 class="week">Week 8</h1>
            <p class="text">For this week, i learnt about jquery. It helps simplify Javascript, and can reference to the elements. It also allows us to access the build in functions, like .hide(),
                and simplify event handling. It also allows us to use build in css actions like 'background-color','green'. We can also access all elements with div using $("div") or $("#page") to select 
                all items with and id of 'page'. We can also get and set data, by selecting the id or class using jquery and changing it all in the javascript. <br>
                I also learnt how to use ajax with api to extract out data.
            </p>

        <div class="box">
            <h1 class="week">Week 9</h1>
            <p class="text">This week i learnt about bootstrap. It is a link where we can use to make out life easier as they have built in functions where we can use in our website. They provide a variety
                of functions, mostly will format itself when in media query. For example, we can use its navbar which is able to display all our pages, and even hide itself when the width becomes smaller

        <div class="box">
            <h1 class="week">Week 12</h1>
            <p class="text">In this week, i learnt about restdb, which is a database where we can use to input data, get data, or even update the existing data. It is an intresting activity as we are able to try
                to input the student variables into the database, update the chosen data, or delete the chosen data. 
            </p>

            <h1 class="week">Week 14</h1>
            <p class="text">For week 14, i learnt about lottie which allows us to input animations and allow us to play it on our websites. We can even convert a SVG to Lottie to use in website. In this week i 
                also continued to work on my assignment which requires the use of restdb, lottie and many other functions that were taught before.
